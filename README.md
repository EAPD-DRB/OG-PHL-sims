# OG-PHL Simulations and Reforms
This repository contains the run scripts, data, and descriptions of simulations and reforms that use the OG-PHL model. The repository for the OG-PHL model is https://github.com/EAPD-DRB/OG-PHL. It can also be downloaded and installed from the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/ogphl/) using the `pip install ogphl` command.

The reforms in this repository are stored in the `./simulations/` folder. Each subfolder represents a particular set of simulations and reforms associated with a specific experiment. At a minimum, each subfolder contains a run script for the corresponding simulation. They should also contain a `README.md` file that explains what the experiment was and how the files relate to each other. Each subfolder might also contain slides, papers, or other presentation materials associated with the simulation.

The current set of reforms and simulations is the following:
- [`./simulations/CapGainsVATreform_2024_10/`](./simulations/CapGainsVATreform_2024_10/). The effect of reducing the Philippine capital gains tax rate and VAT tax rate.
- [`./simulations/Climate_2024_10/`](./simulations/Climate_2024_10/). The effect of permanent climate change on the Philippines.
- [`./simulations/Digitization_2024_10/`](./simulations/Digitization_2024_10/). The effect of Philippine digitization.
- [`./simulations/Infrastructure_2024_10/`](./simulations/Infrastructure_2024_10/). The effect of infrastructure investment.
- [`./simulations/PensionAgeReform_2024_10/`](./simulations/PensionAgeReform_2024_10/). The effect of reducing the pension age from 60 to 56.
